securewallet
============

securewallet is a simple command line password manager. It uses 256-bit AES encryption to protect your data, and is completely open source, so you know what's going on. Feel free to download and edit a copy of the project - send me a mail at ritzymail@gmail.com and I'll probably add your changes if they make a difference in the app. The app should work on Linux (tested) and on Mac (untested) and requires Python and PyCrypto. Feel free to change anything if you want.
