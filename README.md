Welcome to the Git repo for SecureWallet, a simple command line password manager. It uses 256-bit AES encryption to protect your data, and is completely open source, so you know what's going on. Feel free to download and edit a copy of the project - send me a mail at ritzymail@gmail.com and I'll probably add your changes if they make a differencein the app.
